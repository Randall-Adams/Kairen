EQOA Lan Play
EQOA is Everquest Online Adventures
EQOA has been fan-named Return Home, as determined by democratic processes within the community. (We voted for it, man!)

As "fan-named" kinda sounda like "phantomed" and similar derivatives of mixing it with phantom, which is like a ghost, I will dub projects/works like this "phantom" works, at least until I learn a better thing to call them.

As "EQOA Lan Play" sounds better to say, and since current iterations of this project use an emulator and loosely rely on a savestate, which is a small snap-shot of the then-live server, I will generally refer to this project as EQOA Lan Play.
Kairen is the .exe's name.

All of this may be subject to change, generally as "betterness" dictates.
