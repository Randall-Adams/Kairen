EQOA Lan Play  
EQOA is Everquest Online Adventures  
EQOA has been fan-named Return Home, as determined by democratic processes within the community. (We voted for it, man!)

As "fan-named" kinda sounda like "phantomed" and similar derivatives of mixing it with phantom, which is like a ghost, I will dub projects/works like this "phantom" works, at least until I learn a better thing to call them.

As "EQOA Lan Play" sounds better to say than "Return Home Lan Play", and since current iterations of this project use an emulator and loosely rely on a savestate, which is a small snap-shot of the then-live server, I will generally refer to this project as EQOA Lan Play, or Kairen.  
Kairen is the .exe's name technically.

(You can also call this "Return Home Lan Play" or whatever though, if you want, cause like, calling things what they are, is pretty normal.)

All of this may be subject to change, generally as "betterness" dictates.
